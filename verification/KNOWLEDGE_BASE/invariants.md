# Block verification — substrate invariants

Hard-won, model-agnostic rules that apply across block classes. An agent building
or verifying a Kyttar block should read these first. Each is a *constraint* ("always
/ never X"), not a one-block idiosyncrasy. Per-block fixes go in `lessons_log.md`.

## INV-1 — The port target hop count is PLACEMENT-DEPENDENT, never a constant

**Symptom:** a block builds and routes fine but produces **zero outputs** on simKYT.

**Root cause:** the value passed as `target_hop_cnt` to `inject_data_physical` /
`inject_jump_physical` must equal `31 - distance`, where `distance` is the number of
cells the word transits from the `x16_in` port cell to the block's landing cell
(inclusive of the port's own edge cell). The demo tests hardcode `30` only because
their auto-placed head block happens to sit 1 hop from the port. A block placed
elsewhere needs a different hop, and a wrong hop means the WRITE/JUMP is consumed at a
transit cell short of (or past) the block → the program never fires → no output.

**Fix:** derive it from the landing cell position:
`hop = 31 - (abs(landing.x - port.cell_x) + abs(landing.y - port.cell_y) + 1)`.
The **same** hop must be used for both the data inject and the jump inject. (Verified:
GainBlock at (1,1), x16_in at (0,0) → distance 3 → hop 28. Hop 29/30 give 0 output.)
`run_block_dut` in `kyttar_verify` does this for you.

**Applies to:** every block driven through x16_in by a harness that places blocks itself.

## INV-2 — DUT-vs-reference alignment uses the PREDICTED delay, not a lag search

**Symptom (latent):** a block with a real group-delay / off-by-one bug passes anyway.

**Root cause:** cross-correlation lag search picks whatever offset maximizes
similarity, so it slides the streams until a latency bug disappears. Free alignment is
a bug-eraser.

**Fix:** state the block's known group delay (FIR ≈ `(ntaps-1)/2`, a memoryless block
= 0) and assert the DUT exhibits it; compare `y[n]` to `ref[n-delay]`. A `+1` latency
mutation must FAIL when `delay=0` is asserted — that mutation test is mandatory.

**Applies to:** all amplitude/decision metrics.

---

## INV-3 — Model Q15 saturation on the float reference before comparing

**Symptom:** full-scale edge vectors (±1.0, 0x7FFF, 0x8001) false-fail on a correct block.

**Root cause:** Q15 saturates; GR float does not. At full scale the DUT clips where the
float reference keeps growing → spurious large error on exactly the edge vectors we
emphasize. "Fixing" this by loosening the global tolerance hides real errors elsewhere.

**Fix:** clip the float reference to the Q15 range and quantize it *before* diffing.
(`compare_against_grc` does this.) The `0x7FFF * 0.5 = 0x3FFF` single-LSB result is
correct Q15 rounding, not an error — expect ≤1 LSB on a single MULQ.

**Applies to:** every amplitude-metric block; especially gain/mixer/filter at full scale.

---

## INV-4 — A verification gate is worthless until it is proven to FAIL

**Symptom:** "all green" that certifies nothing because the gate can't detect a bug.

**Root cause:** loose tolerance, free lag alignment, transient trimming, or stimulus
that never excites the bug each let a broken block pass green.

**Fix:** every block's test suite MUST include mutation/negative tests that corrupt the
DUT (invert output, wrong parameter, +1 sample delay, empty output) and assert the gate
FAILS. Only then does a green result mean "the gate looked and found nothing," vs
"the gate can't see." Tolerances are derived/locked, never tuned by the agent to pass.

**Applies to:** every block, no exceptions.

---

## INV-5 — Single-block build recipe (the proven path)

`new_project(name, chip_type)` → `place_block(type, 0, x, y, library="lattrex.official",
params=...)` → two `add_logical_connection` calls wiring the block's input port to
`ChipPortEndpoint(0,"x16_in")` and its output port to `ChipPortEndpoint(0,"x16_out")` →
`auto_route_all({chip_type: ct})` → `BuildEngine(cat, yaml).build(project, {chip_type: ct})`
→ drive `simkyt.Chip` (load_bitstream_physical, set_port_entry_address, then per sample:
inject_data_physical + run, inject_jump_physical + run, drain output_available /
read_port_i16 / release_output_ack). Entry + input register come from
`catalog.resolved_io(type)`. Port names for a simple block are `sample` (in) / `out`.

**Gotcha:** setting `project.chip_type` alone is NOT enough — use `new_project(...)` so
the chip instance is initialized; otherwise `block.placement` is None and the router
reports "source block unplaced or port unknown." Pass `library="lattrex.official"`.

**Applies to:** any headless single-block build (the DUT side of verification).

## INV-6 — Resolve a block's entry address WITH its params, never the bare type

**Symptom:** a parameterized block (FIR, anything whose program size varies)
**echoes its input** unchanged, or produces garbage, while the build and route
succeed.

**Root cause:** v2 blocks pack data low and instructions high, so a block's
program length — and therefore its **entry address** — shifts with its
parameters. `resolved_io(type_name)` with NO params constructs the block's
*default* (e.g. a 1-tap FIR → entry 27); the actually-placed block (e.g. a 3-tap
FIR → entry 23) has a different entry. JUMPing to the default entry lands
mid-program (past the input-load and accumulator-prime), so the datapath never
computes a clean output and the raw input passes through.

**Fix:** always resolve with the instance's real params:
`entry, ins = cat.resolved_io(type_name, params)`. `run_block_dut` does this.
(GainBlock hid this — its program length is fixed regardless of gain, so its
entry never moves and any block-class harness tested only on Gain would miss it.)

**Applies to:** every block whose program size depends on its parameters — i.e.
every scaling block (FIR, decimator, IIR, interleaver, …).

## INV-7 — A block's per-cell register budget (~31) caps a single-cell design

**Symptom:** a scaling block's build fails with "no register space" past some
parameter size, or builds as multi-cell but produces **no egress** through the
single-block harness.

**Root cause:** each cell has ~31 usable registers (R0 is the accumulator). A
single-cell FIR holds its coefficients + delay line + scratch + program; past
~7 taps that exceeds the budget (the block's own `<=12 → 1 cell` heuristic is
too optimistic). Above the single-cell ceiling the block becomes a multi-cell
**wavefront** whose output egresses from the *last* cell — which a harness that
derives its hop/drive from `placement.cells[0]` (the input landing cell) does
not yet handle.

**Fix / status:** verify scaling blocks across their *proven* parameter range and
record the ceiling as an explicit known limit (executable guard tests that flip
when fixed) rather than claiming the block is fully done. Multi-cell egress
(driving the last cell, not the first) is a harness capability still to be built.

**Applies to:** FIR, decimator, IIR, and any block that grows past one cell.
