# Block verification — per-block lessons log

Append-only, newest first. One entry per block as it is verified: what was tried,
what passed/failed, the derived tolerance, and any block-specific gotcha. Promote
anything that generalizes across block classes into `invariants.md`.

## GainBlock — verified 2026-06-23

- **Status:** PASS. Edge + 3 random seeds + gain sweep {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9}.
- **Metric:** amplitude, delay=0, op_count=1 → derived tolerance 2 LSB.
- **Result:** max_abs_err 1 LSB, NMSE ~-90 dB, corr 1.0000. The 1-LSB error is
  correct Q15 rounding of a single MULQ (e.g. 0x7FFF*0.5 = 0x3FFF).
- **Mutation tests:** inverted output, wrong gain, +1 sample offset, empty output
  all correctly FAIL the gate.
- **Gotcha:** hit the placement-dependent hop-count trap (zero output) before the
  fix — see invariants.md INV-1. GainBlock is the template for feed-forward,
  single-cell, single-MULQ blocks.
